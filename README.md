# VideoDG: Generalizing Temporal Relations in Videos to Novel Domains
A PyTorch implementation of APN, a differentiable framework named adversarial pyramid network is a new deep architecture thatimproves the generalizability of video features by capturing the local-relation, global-relation, and cross-relation features progressively. Based on these pyramid features, we also propose a new adversarial data augmentation approach that can enhance the diversity and qualityof the augmented data to bridge different video domains.
